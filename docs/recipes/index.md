# Enforma Recipes

In this section you can find recipes to solve some form related issues:

- **Components**
  - [Multi-input fields](multi-input-field.md) - a number range with 2 inputs for `min` and `max`
  - [Address picker](address-picker.md) - a radio-buttons style selector list with "add address" functionality
- **Validation**
  - [Async validation rule](async-validation.md) - checking if an email is already in use
- **Other Scenarios**
  - [Forms in modals](form-in-modal.md) - displaying a form inside a modal
